Eval function explanation

For this program, my eval function for depth-limited search is very simple.
It takes in the current GameBoard as a parameter, and then returns the current score
for the max player, which was initialized at the beginning of minimax. 
This is a good enough eval function since max will want the highest score, while 
min will want the lowest max score.
